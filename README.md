# EventFlow--The-Event-Management-System

The EventFlow System is an online platform designed to connect venue owners and users, simplifying the process of venue booking and event participation. The system allows venue owners to list their venues with relevant details, while users can search, book, and manage their reservations efficiently. It primarily focuses on sports venues and activities, enabling users to discover local sporting events, find players, and register for activities.

The system provides role-based access, differentiating between general users and venue owners. Users can create profiles, search for venues or events based on filters (sport type, location, cost, availability), and reserve a venue with an integrated payment and notification system. Venue owners, on the other hand, can manage their listings, track bookings, and control venue availability. Additional features include chat functionality, allowing users and organizers to communicate seamlessly. A recommendation system suggests venues based on user history and preferences. The system integrates Google Maps for navigation, provides a waiting list feature for full events, and allows users to bookmark venues for future reference. Security measures include OAuth authentication, password encryption, captcha verification, and two-factor authentication to ensure user data protection. Users can also rate and review venues after booking, enhancing transparency and trust in the system.
Overall, the platform creates a streamlined, user-friendly experience for event and venue management, ensuring seamless interaction between participants, organizers, and venue owners.
